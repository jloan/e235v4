In the next phase of our work with PierceHacker, we'll be taking action on the recommendations offered by the reports.

## Overview

Working in small teams of writers/editors, utilize recommendations from our analytic reports to draft:

* Two tutorials/lessons
* One additional project resource (e.g. revised survey, purposed addition to project website, promotional poster, etc.)

## Writing Tutorials/Lessons

In drafting tutorials/lessons, I am going to ask you to follow the process I envision for how new lessons will be written for the site in the future. A reminder, I'm modeling PierceHacker after [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/contribute) project.

1. Propose your new tutorials/lessons using this [proposal form](https://jloan.github.io/pierce-hacker/assets/tutorial-proposal-form.txt). Submit proposal forms to jloan@pierce.ctc.edu. Use subject line "PierceHacker Lesson Proposal." Be sure to CC all group members in email.
2. All new lessons/tutorials should be written in Markdown and submitted via GitHub to this [repository](https://github.com/jloan/pierce-hacker-submissions). Use this [template](https://github.com/jloan/pierce-hacker-submissions/blob/master/lessons/lesson-template.md) for drafting lessons. 

## Composing Additional Project Resources

Possibilities for project resources beyond lessons/tutorials is multiple.

1. Revised surveys should be submitted to this GDrive [folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pMhS-X2fDSoRDj7X0Ort_RNXLOhBg86D) in "ph-surveys." 
2. Revisions/additions to the PierceHacker Project website should made by using a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on GitHub. 
3. Any other additional project resources should be submitted to the [ph-resources folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pMhS-X2fDSoRDj7X0Ort_RNXLOhBg86D) on GDrive.

## Offering Feedback on Lessons

1. Each small group will also serve as co-editors for another group during the process of lesson drafting. They will offer feedback on lesson via the GitHib [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) process.
2. Additionally feedback can be offered to additional project resources via Google Drive.

## Timeline for Action Phase

Lesson proposals **due** by start of class on Wednesday, May 15.

Lesson drafts and additional respources **due** by start of class on Wednesday, May 22nd.
