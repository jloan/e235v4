This week we've continues the process of participating in the prototype of the [PierceHacker project](https://jloan.github.io/pierce-hacker/). 


* This week I'd like you to put the research in "research log." Following our survey work, the next phase of the PierceHacker Project is to write an analytical report for the project. Conduct some personal reserach into this genre (or type) of writing. Locate resources that will help you better understand and ultimately compose an analytical report. For example: sample reports, how-to's, OER Textbook chapters, etc. Reflect on what you learn from these resources and share the most helpful things you've found with your peers to this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVuBlijFbDcUOv_7hAnewDqrN8-Yhca4jo1cSGuCbvE/edit?usp=sharing). Be sure to add a little summary/commentary on how you found this resource helpful.

* As always, what do you think you learned this week?  Keep in mind that your learning might resonate with particualr course outcomes or personal outcomes or even something unexpected or not entirely anticipated by either articualted course or personal outcomes.
