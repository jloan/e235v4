This week focus you log on the process of drafting/revising your analytic reports.

* Describe as best you can your process/approach to drafting the report. Challenges, questions, what worked, why did you make the specifiic choices that you did, etc.
* Capture the in-progress feedback you received in class on Thursday. How did your reader(s) respond to your draft? What suggestions or ideas did they have in furthering your work?
* Make a plans for finalizing the report. Based on the assignment and the initial feedback -- where do you go between now and Monday?
* As always, what do you think you learned this week?  Keep in mind that your learning might resonate with particualr course outcomes or personal outcomes or even something unexpected or not entirely anticipated by either articualted course or personal outcomes.
