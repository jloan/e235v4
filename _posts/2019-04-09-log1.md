#### Week 1

* Introduce yourself. 
* Describe your own initial understandings and assumptions about "technical writing" as you start the course. How do your initial understandings/assumptions align (or not) with the readings we have done this week?
* Describe and reflect on your work in setting up an account and repository on GitHub. The "Hello World" tutorial/guide on GitHub is an example of tech writing. What did you notice about it? What seem to  be this sort of texts key characterisics and features?
* [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) and [PierceHacker](https://jloan.github.io/pierce-hacker/) are perhaps many things, but they are I believe technical writing projects at their core. Our reading "The Rhetorical Nature of Technical and Professional Writing" frames tech writing as fundementally rhetorical. This means that questions of purpose, audience, and medium of delivery are as fundemental to the work of technical writing. Consider -- who is the particular audience for The Programming Historian? For Pierce Hacker? What is the purpose of The Programming Historian? Of PierceHacker? Why do you think the writers/designers of these projects decisded to deliver their work via the medium of a public website?
