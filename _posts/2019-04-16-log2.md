This week we've taken up a mini-project building Lego designs and drafting instructional texts for their rebuilding. 

* Reflect on your experience in composing these instruction sets -- attempt to describe all of the choices you made in the process of realizing your composition.

* Technical Writing -- like any field or category of writing -- is rhetorically situated. That means that questions of audience are essential considerations to what's produced. Even though this is a classroom excercise -- what sense of audience for these instructions do you have? How, if at all, has this sense of audience -- that you are designing this text for a reader -- infromed the choices you made in producing the composition?

* I have left it up to you as to how you deliver your instructional text to your audience. You could choose Word, PowerPoint, HTML or any number of mediums or platforms. How did you decide to deliver your composition and what factors motivated that choice? Ultimately, what do you think your choice of delivery medium/platform get you as a writer?

* Finally, what do you think you learned this week?  Keep in mind that your learning might resonate with particualr course outcomes or personal outcomes or even something unexpected or not entirely anticipated by either articualted course or personal outcomes.
