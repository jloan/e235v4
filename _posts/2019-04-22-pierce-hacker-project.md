In this project students will contribute lesson/tutorial materials to the [PierceHacker](https://jloan.github.io/pierce-hacker/) project website.

This project will unfold in multiple phases.

#### Phase 1 

Compose a survey in order to gather data on Pierce student technology use and needs. Write an analytical report on findings. 

Key question(s): What tools/technologies are students using in relation to thier classes/education? If the goal of PierceHacker is to support Pierce students in developing information competency, what technology tutorials/lessons would be the most beneficial for PierceHacker to publish?  

You can find our survey darft [here](https://forms.gle/qmAWrUh93AJ9o4Nv7) and more details about the expectaions for Analytical Reports [here](_posts/2019-05-01-phreport.md).
