In this mini-project/workshop I want you to locate and consult at least 5 different guides/tutorials for *writing with Markdown*. Attempt to use what you learn in the tutorials to add the following style/format elements to your Research Log(s):

* Headers
* Lists
* Blockquotes
* Emphasis
* Images
* Links
* Horizontal Rule

After attempting to apply some formatting/style to your Research Logs, compose a new Markdown document in your repository. In this document, rank the tutorials you consulted in your order of preference of usability. Provide a rationale for each of these rankings (i.e. why one might be ranked higher than another). And...remember to use appropriate formatting/style elemnts in composing this document (i.e. link to the tutorials you consulted).
